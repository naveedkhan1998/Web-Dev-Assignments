    <h1>Benefits of Physical Activity</h1>
    <div class="benefit">
      <strong>Immediate Benefits:</strong>
      <p>
        Engaging in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity can lead to immediate
        improvements in brain health, reducing anxiety in adults and enhancing
        cognitive skills in children aged 6 to 13. It can also combat
        depression, anxiety, and promote better sleep.

    </div>

    <div class="benefit">
      <strong>Weight Management:</strong>
      <p>
        Physical activity plays a vital role in maintaining a healthy weight.
        It's advised to work towards 150 minutes of moderate activity per week,
        such as dancing or yard work, to maintain weight. To lose weight
        effectively, one should combine physical activity with a balanced diet.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="benefit">
      <strong>Reducing Health Risks:</strong>
      <p>
        Physical activity can reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases like
        heart disease and stroke, lower blood pressure, and improve cholesterol
        levels. It also decreases the risk of type 2 diabetes, metabolic
        syndrome, and certain infections, including COVID-19, the flu, and
        pneumonia.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="benefit">
      <strong>Cancer Prevention:</strong>
      <p>
        Regular physical activity can lower the risk of developing various
        cancers, such as bladder, breast, colon, endometrium, esophagus, kidney,
        lung, and stomach cancers. It can also improve the quality of life for
        cancer survivors.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="benefit">
      <strong>Strengthening Bones and Muscles:</strong>
      <p>
        Muscle-strengthening activities, such as weight lifting, help maintain
        or increase muscle mass and strength, which is especially important for
        older adults. This can protect bones, joints, and muscles, enabling
        individuals to perform daily activities.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="benefit">
      <strong>Improving Daily Functionality and Fall Prevention:</strong>
      <p>
        Physical activity reduces the risk of functional limitations, especially
        in older adults, making it easier to perform daily tasks. It also lowers
        the risk of hip fractures, which can be life-changing for older
        individuals.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="benefit">
      <strong>Increasing Longevity:</strong>
      <p>
        Regular physical activity can significantly increase one's chances of
        living longer. Even small increases in activity can prevent thousands of
        deaths annually. More steps taken each day are associated with a lower
        risk of premature death.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="benefit">
      <strong>Managing Chronic Health Conditions & Disabilities:</strong>
      <p>
        Physical activity is beneficial for managing chronic conditions and
        disabilities. It can reduce pain, improve function and mood in
        individuals with arthritis, help control blood sugar levels and lower
        the risk of heart disease for those with type 2 diabetes, and promote
        independence and daily living activities for people with disabilities.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      In summary, physical activity offers immediate and long-term benefits for
      people of all ages, regardless of their physical condition or size. It
      improves physical and mental health, reduces the risk of chronic diseases,
      supports weight management, and enhances overall quality of life.
